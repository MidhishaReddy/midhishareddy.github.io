								<p>Hi, I'm Midhisha Bhimireddy, a software engineer with 4+ years of experience in developing cloud-based applications with varied functionalities. I have experience working with a wide range of technologies and frameworks such as Java, GOSU, Spring Boot, REST API, JUnit, MySQL, and AWS. I'm passionate about using my coding abilities to create impactful solutions that solve complex business problems and deliver value to end-users.</p>

									<p>During my tenure as a software engineer at CGI Inc., I played a key role in developing a novel cloud-based Insurance Management System that handled customer policy, billing, and claims. Through this project, I was able to eliminate redundant code, automate check disbursements, and develop a series of Spring Boot API protocols that improved resource management.</p>

									<p>I'm currently pursuing Master's in Computer Science with a focus on advanced algorithms, system design, cloud computing, and cyber security. In addition to my professional work, I enjoy working on personal coding projects to explore new technologies and expand my skill set. One such project was deploying a Federated Learning framework on AWS, which allowed me to train a machine learning model on distributed data without sharing data between server and clients. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with AWS, PyTorch, and FedML.</p>

									<p>I'm always looking for opportunities to work on interesting projects and collaborate with like-minded people. Please feel free to take a look at my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s6RfMRvZqp7EgC1F-VMOQRs4pAk_2dIM/view?usp=sharing">resume</a> and get in touch if you think I'd be a good fit for your team or project..</p>
